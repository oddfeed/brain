# A Methodology of Possession

Garbage time never ends."A Methodology of Possession is a philosophical Hellraiser narrating Ellis's ego-shattering journey to the outside of time following the demonic guidance of accursed philosopher Nick Land. No writer has followed Land so far into the abysmal labyrinths of templexity and returned to tell the tale. At last a philosofiction worthy of its diabolical mentor." - John Cussans, author of Undead Uprising: Haiti, Horror and the Zombie Complex
