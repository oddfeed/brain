# The Management of Savagery

"Naji explains how al-Qaeda plans to defeat the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East, establish sanctuaries for Jihadis, correct organizational problems, and create better propaganda. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the strategic thinking of al-Qaeda's leadership and the future of the jihadi movement."--Http://www.ctc.usma.edu/naji.asp.
