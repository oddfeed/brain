# Operation Mind Control: the CIA's Plot Against America

"The Manchurian Candidate" was fiction. This, however, is fact. This could be the most terrifying true story ever to emerge regarding the U.S. national security state - the first book ever written about the CIA's mind control programs. The book became an instant classic, in part because the CIA bought up all the copies it could, simply to keep them off the shelves and out of the hands of the public. In these pages, author Walter Bowart uncovered a huge government "cryptocracy" dedicated to controlling and manipulating human minds. Through hypnosis and drugs, ordinary citizens became CIA "zombies": human computers, spies, trained assassins, and couriers with no control over, or memory of, their actions. Only unexplained memory gaps, multiple personality disorders, or other "mistakes" in programming revealed that something was amiss. Could you be one of the thousands of people ready to be "triggered" into action by some seemingly random cue? Bowart's devastating account includes top secret documents outlining the cryptocracy's cold-blooded programs, as well as startling new evidence linking "assassins" Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan to Operation Mind Control.
